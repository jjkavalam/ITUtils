# ITUtils

A collection of utilities for every day office / personal use that can be piped together. Inspired by the Unix philosophy.

Most office work in today's age is IT enabled. For example, recently, I wanted to collect some details (photograph, favourite Bible verse) from my graduating class so as to prepare a deck of slides. At first I turned to a few well known IT solutions to do the job and found out that they wouldn't exactly fit my need. Hence, I ended up asking each student to email the details to me, which I later compiled manually.

I believe such as situation is not uncommon in most people's experience. And as such, I offer here an approach which I believe has the potential to trully solve this problem.

To explain, the core tenents of this approach, I borrow the words of Unix pioneer, Douglas McIlroy:

(i) Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.

(ii) Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.

This approach of combining small utilities that do their specific tasks really well is something that has survived many decades in the community of programmers. I believe, something substantial can be accomplished by applying this approach to the problems of everyday tasks. This is what this project strives to demonstrate.
